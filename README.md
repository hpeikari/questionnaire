### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### Notes

There were some design discrepencies which I tried to ignore.

The hover/active/disabled styles for buttons were mainly ignored since design was not provided.

Form validation was not implemented. i.e. I allow adding a new question and submitting the form even if the quastionnair form elements were not populated.

Login is fake but should demonstrate at a high level what can be done. I did not attempt building too much around it since the requirements were not called out.

I did not attempt implementing the reordering the list.
