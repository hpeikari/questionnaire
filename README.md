Fueled Take Home project.

Attached is the zip file of the assignment. I skipped a couple of few things here and there since I am traveling for the next several days and I won;tbe able to spend any more time on it. However, the parts that I completed should be more than enough to demonstrate my React/JS skills. Some cleanup and improvements can surely be done, and adding TS and static typic with enums would be a huge plus, but again, I skipped it all since I didn't have time. I am in fact about to sign-off and hit the road in a few minutes :D 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### Notes

There were some design discrepencies which I tried to ignore.

The hover/active/disabled styles for buttons were mainly ignored since design was not provided.

Form validation was not implemented. i.e. I allow adding a new question and submitting the form even if the quastionnair form elements were not populated.

Login is fake but should demonstrate at a high level what can be done. I did not attempt building too much around it since the requirements were not called out.

I did not attempt implementing the reordering the list.
